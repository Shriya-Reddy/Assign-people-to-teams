# Assign-people-to-teams
The problem is to assign people to teams such that the time taken by instrucor to grade the assignments.
The grading cost is calculated in four steps:
It will take 5 minutes to grade each assignment, so total grading time is 5 times the number of teams.
• Each student who requested a specific group size and was assigned to a different group size will send
a complaint email to an instructor, and it will take the instructor 2 minutes to read this email.
• If a student is not assigned to someone they requested, there is a 5% probability that the two students will still share code, and if this happens it will take 60 minutes for the instructor to walk through the Academic Integrity Policy with them. If a student requested to work with multiple people, then this will happen independently for each person they were not assigned to. If both students requested each other, there will be two meetings.
• Each student who is assigned to someone they requested not to work with (in question 3 above) complains to the Dean, who meets with the instructor for 10 minutes. If a student is assigned to a group with multiple people they did not want to work with, a separate meeting will be needed for each.
Time taken to grade will be equal to sum of all times mentioned above.
